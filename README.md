Peugeot 206 Type 2 Price Prediction using Web Scraping and Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for training a machine learning model to predict the price of a Peugeot 206 Type 2 car based on its features. The data for this project will be obtained through web scraping of car sales ads from the Divar website. The trained model will then be used to predict whether the price suggested by a seller is reasonable or not.
